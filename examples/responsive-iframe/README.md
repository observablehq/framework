# Responsive iframe

View live: <https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-responsive-iframe/>

This Observable Framework example demonstrates how to implement a responsive iframe such that the height of the iframe automatically adjusts to show all of the content without scrolling. This example also demonstrates how to turn off Framework’s additional user interface elements (such as the sidebar) so that the embedded page contains only content. The main page is in [`src/index.md`](./src/index.md?plain=1) and the embedded page is in [`src/embed.md`](./src/embed.md?plain=1).

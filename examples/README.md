# Observable Framework examples

*First:* [Get started with Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started)

*This repository shows different flavors and features of what you can build with Framework:*

- **API** — Millions of API requests, stored in Arrow format, are analyzed in a report. [[code](./api)] [[live project](https://observablehq.com/framework/examples/api/)]
- **Chess** — A data loader that retrieves several large zip files from the FIDE, extracts information about the top 10 players, and displays a rank chart. [[code](./chess)] [[live project](https://observablehq.com/framework/examples/chess/)]

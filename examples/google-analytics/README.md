# Google analytics

This dashboard tracks data from Google Analytics using the [Google Analytics Data API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/quickstart-client-libraries). It contains a single page in `docs/index.md`.

View the [live project](https://observablehq.com/framework/examples/google-analytics/).

## Data loaders

To connect the data loaders to the Analytics API, you will need to set up a `.env` file at the root of this directory with three variables:

```
GA_PROPERTY_ID=111111111
GA_CLIENT_EMAIL=xxxx@yyy.gserviceaccount.com
GA_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nxxxxxxxxxx-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

There is also a hard-coded path in the data loaders (in this case, to define a `stringFilter` that restricts the loader to views on the Observable Plot documentation); you can modify it with a different path or remove it entirely.

The Google Analytics [API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/quickstart-client-libraries) guide will walk you through how to set this up for your own instance of Google Analytics.

## Charts

The dashboard displays a variety of charts, made with [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/). With the key numbers at the top, a line chart or an area chart. Activity by country is represented by a choropleth map. Active users use a horizon chart, faceted by channel. The “new vs. returning” chart is a Marimekko. Finally, the activity by day and hour is a punchcard chart. The code for each of these charts is available in [docs/index.md](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/blob/main/examples/google-analytics/docs/index.md).

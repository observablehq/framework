# Hello, world!

This is a minimal example of Observable Framework.

This project has the following structure:

```ini
.
├─ src
│  └─ index.md
├─ observablehq.config.js
└─ package.json
```

You’re currently reading the main (and only) page of this project, `src/index.md`, which lives inside the source root, `src`.

The `observablehq.config.js` project config file is optional. We use it to add the Observable header and “view source” link.

The last file, `package.json`, is used to install Observable Framework via npm. It also provides a few useful common commands such as building and deploying.

# Framework + NetCDF

View live: <https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-netcdf/>

This Observable Framework example demonstrates how to use the [`netcdfjs` library](https://github.com/cheminfo/netcdfjs) to read a NetCDF file, and then to display it as a raster plot using Observable Plot. The code is in [`src/index.md`](./src/index.md?plain=1). The example data is global marine winds from NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.

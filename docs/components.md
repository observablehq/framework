# Components

Components are reusable pieces of code that make it quicker and easier to control page layout and add common page content (like charts, big numbers, and expandable text).

When working in the Observable CLI, there are three flavors of components: 

1. **Layout** helpers 
2. **Observable Plot** examples 
3. **Observable Inputs**

## Layout helpers

## Chart examples in Observable Plot

Observable Plot is our open source JavaScript library 

## Observable Inputs

Observable Inputs are lightweight interface components — buttons, sliders, dropdowns, checkboxes, and the like — that help you explore data and build interactive displays. Add an Input to your page

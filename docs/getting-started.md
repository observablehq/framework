# Getting started

Welcome! This tutorial will guide your first steps with Observable Framework. If you follow this tutorial to the end, youâ€™ll have a live dashboard ready to share. ðŸš€

Before we begin, letâ€™s review the development workflow, end-to-end. Observable Framework is a **local development server**, a **static site generator**, and a **command-line interface** to Observable, all rolled into one!

```js
const digraph = dot`digraph {
  rankdir=LR

  install -> create -> edit -> preview -> build -> deploy -> view
  preview -> edit
  install
  view

  subgraph cluster_develop {
    label = "develop"
    color = "gray"
    edit
    preview
  }

  subgraph cluster_publish {
    label = "publish"
    color = "gray"
    build
    deploy
  }
}`;
```

Youâ€™ll first need to setup your local development environment by [**installing**](#1.-install) Observable Framework and [**creating**](#2.-create) a new project.

Next youâ€™ll [**develop**](#3.-develop)! This is an iterative process where you save changes to Markdown and other source files in your preferred editor, and then observe the result in a local preview running in your browser.

When youâ€™re ready to share with your team (or the world), itâ€™s time to [**publish**](#4.-publish). You can either build a static site for self-hosting or hosting on a third-party such as GitHub or Netlify, or you can deploy directly to Observable.

Lastly, you can invite people to [**view**](#5.-view) your project!

## 1. Install

Observable Framework is a Node.js application published to npm as [`@observablehq/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@observablehq/cli). The instructions below are intended to run in your [terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac). Youâ€™ll need to install [Node.js 20.6 or later](https://nodejs.org/) before you can install Framework.

We recommend starting with our default project template<!-- https://github.com/observablehq/create -->. This currently requires <!-- either npm or --> Yarn 1.x. If you already have Yarn installed, you can check the version like so:

```sh
yarn --version
```

If needed, you can install Yarn via npm:

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

See the [Yarn 1.x installation instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/docs/install) for details.

## 2. Create

Next, run [`@observablehq/create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@observablehq/create) to create a new project using our default template.

```sh
npm init @observablehq
```

This will ask you several questions.

First, youâ€™ll be askedâ€¦

<pre>
? <b>Project folder name:</b> â€º hello-world
</pre>

```ini
? Project title (visible on the pages): â€º Hello, world!
```

Weâ€™ll use the name `hello-world` for our project.

After answering a few questions, this command will create a new project folder in the current working directory.

```sh
cd hello-world
```

```sh
yarn
```

## 3. Develop

After youâ€™ve initialized your project, you can start developing locally. In preview mode, Observable Framework generates HTML pages on-demand as you view a local version of your site in the browser. As you edit files, changes will be instantly reflected in the browser.

To start the preview server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Then visit <http://127.0.0.1:3000> to preview.

By default, the preview server is only visible to you on your local machine using the loopback address `127.0.0.1`. You can open access to remote connections using <nobr>`--host 0.0.0.0`</nobr>. The preview server runs on port 3000 by default (or the next available port if the former is already in use); you can specify the port with the <nobr>`--port`</nobr> flag.

## 4. Publish

When youâ€™re ready to deploy your project, use the `build` command to generate the output root (`dist`). You can then copy the `dist` folder to your static site server.

To generate your static site:

```sh
yarn build
```

You can then use `npx http-server dist` to preview your built site.

If youâ€™d like to host your project on the [Observable platform](https://observablehq.com) and share it securely with your team, use the `deploy` command.

To deploy your project to Observable:

```sh
yarn deploy
```

Once done, the command will print the URL where you can view your project on the Observable Cloud. It will follow this pattern:

```
https://observablehq.com/@<workspace>/<project-slug>
```

## 5. View

Invite users, share a linkâ€¦

## Next steps

Here are a few more tips.

### Deploying via GitHub Actions

You can schedule builds and deploy your project automatically on commit, or on a schedule. Weâ€™ll share example source code soon, but please reach out and ask if you have questions on how to setup continuous deployment.

### Installing into an existing project

You can install Observable Framework as a dependency on an existing project if you donâ€™t want to create a new project using our default template as described above.

```sh
npm install https://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@github.com/observablehq/cli
```

```sh
yarn add https://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@github.com/observablehq/cli
```

You can also install Observable Framework globally so that the `observable` command is available across projects, but we donâ€™t recommend this approach. By installing Observable Framework into each project, everyone you work with will use the same version.

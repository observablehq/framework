Observable Framework ‚Äî or ‚ÄúFramework‚Äù for short ‚Äî is an open-source static-site generator for data apps. By *data app* we mean an application that is primarily a display of data. A data app helps you derive insights (to understand) and evaluate potential decisions (to take action).

A data app might be a set of coordinated **interactive visualizations** for ‚Äúself-service‚Äù exploratory analysis, perhaps to better understand a computational model or to investigate activity;

    <div class="small arrow">Taxi rides in New York City</div>
  </a>
</div>

‚Ä¶ a **live dashboard** that shows what is currently happening, placing current events in context of recent or historical trends;

    <div class="small arrow">Observable Plot downloads</div>
  </a>
</div>

‚Ä¶ a **point-in-time report** that combines graphics and prose to present in-depth analysis, perhaps with recommendations or hypotheses about observed behavior;

‚Ä¶ or any number of other displays of data. Data apps are useful in almost every domain: business intelligence, product analytics, monitoring operations, scientific reporting, and more. Data apps are tools for thought ‚Äî for answering questions, exploring possibilities, organizing knowledge, and communicating insights.

Why use Framework for your data apps? Here are a few reasons.

## The power of code

Business intelligence as code. Alternative to custom web development.

Open-source. File-based development.

Framework is free and open-source. Projects are just local files. Use your favorite editor, preview locally, check it all into git, write unit tests, add CI/CD, even work offline. You can host projects anywhere or deploy instantly to Observable to share them securely with your team.

Modern development is built on files. Files have myriad strengths, but the strongest is interoperability. When every tool uses files, it‚Äôs far easier to incorporate a new tool ‚Äî and now Observable ‚Äî into your workflow.

This isn‚Äôt just about using your preferred text editor. Now you can bring your own source control and code review system, too. You can write unit tests and run linters. You can automate builds with continuous integration or deployment. You can work offline. You can self-host. You can generate or edit content programmatically, say to format code or to find-and-replace across files.

Data apps tend to be highly opinionated and customized to the bespoke demands of a data-driven organization.

## Polyglot meets the web

Most web application frameworks focus on a single language ‚Äî¬†say Next.js for JavaScript, Streamlit for Python, or Shiny for R. Framework is polyglot, meaning it can use multiple languages together. A polyglot approach is especially relevant for data apps, where data teams like to use Python or R (or other specialized languages) for data analysis, while leveraging the full power of JavaScript for client-side interactive graphics. Now you can have your cake and eat it too. üç∞

Framework‚Äôs emphasis on client-side JavaScript affords fantastic expressivity for custom, performant, interactive graphics. And Framework‚Äôs polyglot data loader architecture affords limitless flexibility preparing and crunching data. Whether your team prefers Python, R, SQL, or something else, Framework can help you build a better data app.

## Static-site architecture

Fewer moving parts. Easier to host anywhere. Great performance.

A toolmaker can‚Äôt care only about the developer experience ‚Äî what does the developer experience matter if the resulting app is not demonstrably better? The merit of a creative tool should be judged by the quality of its creations, not its process. Or: ‚Äúthe proof of the pudding is in the eating.‚Äù

We believe that well-designed tools help developers build more efficiently by focusing their efforts on high-value work. We favor opinionated tools, with defaults and conveniences that foster a good user experience. We nudge you into the pit of success.

Framework‚Äôs lightweight Markdown syntax ‚Äî with light and dark mode, thoughtful colors, responsive grids, and built-in navigation ‚Äî gives you beautiful pages from the start. It‚Äôs highly customizable if you need it, but it‚Äôs quick to get started with batteries included.

Most importantly, Framework‚Äôs data architecture practically forces your app to be fast because data is precomputed. Performance is critical for dashboards: users don‚Äôt like to wait, and dashboards only create value if users look at them. Slow dashboards waste time. (And you certainly don‚Äôt want your database and dashboard falling over under load!)

Observable Framework solves the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem of data apps: loading data. Conventional dashboards are slow because they run queries on view while the user waits; Framework‚Äôs data loaders run on build so that pages load instantly. And because data loaders run on your servers, you control privacy and security.

Framework‚Äôs data loaders solve this ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù problem by computing static data snapshots at build time. These snapshots can be highly-optimized (and aggregated and anonymized), minimizing the data you send to the client. And since a data loader is just a fancy way of generating a file on-demand (with clever caching and routing), loaders can be written in any language and use any library. This flexibility is not unlike CGI from 30 years ago, and Unix pipes. And since data loaders run on your servers, viewers don‚Äôt need direct access to the underlying data sources, and your dashboards are more secure and robust.

The speed of modern data warehouses is astonishing. But far too often something is missing for new analysis ‚Äî some untapped data source, some not-yet-materialized view for a query to run at interactive speeds. Framework‚Äôs data loaders let you bypass these hurdles and produce a fast dashboard without ‚Äúheavy lifting‚Äù in your data warehouse. And once your analysis demonstrates value, you can shift work to your data warehouse and simplify your data loaders. Framework lets you build faster and quickly validate your ideas.

## Automatic reactivity

Data visualization. User interaction. Real-time updates.

## An end-to-end solution

We believe Framework will change how you think about data, and effect a better user experience. And by securely hosting apps alongside notebooks, Observable now offers an end-to-end solution for data analysis and presentation.

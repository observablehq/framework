# Markdown

See [GitHub’s guide to Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for an introduction.

What’s different about Observable Markdown?

- [Live JavaScript](./javascript), either as code blocks or inline expressions
- Built-in support for [${tex`\TeX`}](./tex), [Dot (GraphViz)](./dot), and [Mermaid](./mermaid)
- [HTML](./html) (but watch out for blank lines)
- YAML front matter

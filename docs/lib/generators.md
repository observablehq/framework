# Observable Generators

The Observable standard library includes several generator utilities. These are available by default in Markdown as `Generators`, but you can import them explicitly:

```js echo
import {Generators} from "npm:@observablehq/stdlib";
```

## input(*element*)

Returns an async generator that yields whenever the given *element* emits an *input* event, with the given *element*’s current value. (It’s a bit fancier than that because we special-case a few element types.) The built-in [`view` function](<../javascript/inputs#view(element)>) uses this.

```js echo
const nameInput = display(document.createElement("input"));
const name = Generators.input(nameInput);
```

```js echo
name
```

## observe(*change*)

Returns an async generator that yields whenever the callback function *change* is called, with the value passed.

```js echo
const hash = Generators.observe((change) => {
  const changed = () => change(location.hash);
  addEventListener("hashchange", changed);
  changed();
  return () => removeEventListener("hashchange", changed);
});
```
```js echo
hash
```

## queue(*change*)

Returns an async generator that yields whenever the callback function *change* is called, with the value passed. This is identical to Generators.observe, except that if *change* is called multiple times before the consumer has a chance to process the yielded result, values will not be dropped; use this if you require that the consumer not miss a yielded value.

```js run=false
const hash = Generators.queue((change) => {
  const changed = () => change(location.hash);
  addEventListener("hashchange", changed);
  changed();
  return () => removeEventListener("hashchange", changed);
});
```
```js echo
hash
```

## now()

Returns a generator that repeatedly yields `Date.now()`, forever. This generator is available by default as `now` in Markdown.

```js run=false
const now = Generators.now();
```

```js echo
now
```

## width(*element*)

Returns an async generator that yields the width of the given target *element*. Using a [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver), the generator will yield whenever the width of the *element* changes. This generator for the `main` element is available by default as `width` in Markdown.

```js run=false
const width = Generators.width(document.querySelector("main"));
```

```js echo
width
```

## dark() <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/framework/pull/1025" target="_blank" class="observablehq-version-badge" data-version="prerelease" title="Added in #1025"></a>

Returns an async generator that yields a boolean indicating whether the page is currently displayed with a dark [color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme).

If the page supports dark mode (for example with the default Framework themes), the value reflects the user’s preferred color scheme. It will yield if that value changes, and update the charts that depend on it without needing to reload the page — this happens at dusk (if the user settings adapt from light to dark), and conversely at dawn, from dark to light; and of course, when the user is playing with their settings.

If the page does _not_ support dark mode, and only has a light theme, the value is always false, and likewise it is always true if the page only has a dark theme.

```js echo
html`<em>Current theme: ${dark ? "dark" : "light"}</em>`
```

This generator is available by default as `dark` in Markdown. It can be used to pick a [color scheme](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/scales#color-scales) for a chart, or an appropriate [mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode):

```js echo
Plot.plot({
  height: 260,
  color: {scheme: dark ? "turbo" : "blues"},
  marks: [
    Plot.rectY(
      olympians,
      Plot.binX(
        {y2: "count"},
        {
          x: "weight",
          fill: "weight",
          z: "sex",
          mixBlendMode: dark ? "screen" : "multiply"
        }
      )
    ),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

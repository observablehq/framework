# DOT (Graphviz)

[DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) is a language for expressing node-link diagrams using [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org). Observable provides a `dot` tagged template literal powered by [Viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz-js). This is available by default in Markdown, or you can import it like so:

```js echo
import dot from "npm:@observablehq/dot";
```

To use in a JavaScript code block:

```js echo
dot`digraph G {
  rankdir = LR
  a -> b -> c
}`
```

You can also write DOT in a `dot` fenced code block:

````md
```dot
digraph G {
  rankdir = LR
  a -> b -> c
}
```
````

This produces:

```dot
digraph G {
  rankdir = LR
  a -> b -> c
}
```

Here are some more examples.

```dot echo
graph { n0 -- n1 -- n2 -- n3 -- n0 }
```

```dot echo
digraph { x -> y -> z }
```

```dot echo
digraph G {
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3
    label = "process #1"
    color = lightblue
  }
  subgraph cluster_1 {
    b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3
    label = "process #2"
    color = orange
  }
  start -> a0
  start -> b0
  a1 -> b3
  b2 -> a3
  a3 -> a0
  a3 -> end
  b3 -> end
  start [shape = diamond]
  end [shape = square]
}
```

If you donâ€™t mind losing the conveniences of the built-in wrapper such as responsive light and dark mode, you can also use Viz.js directly. For example:

```js echo
import {instance} from "npm:@viz-js/viz";

const viz = await instance();

display(
  viz.renderSVGElement({
    directed: false,
    edges: [
      {tail: "a", head: "b"},
      {tail: "b", head: "c"},
      {tail: "c", head: "a"}
    ]
  })
);
```

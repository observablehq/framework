# D3

[D3](https://d3js.org/what-is-d3) by Observable (also known as D3.js) is a free, open-source JavaScript library for visualizing data. Its low-level approach built on web standards offers unparalleled flexibility in authoring dynamic, data-driven graphics.

D3 (currently version ${(await FileAttachment("versions.json").json()).d3}) is available by default as `d3` in Markdown, but you can import it explicitly like so:

```js echo
import * as d3 from "npm:d3";
```

We recommend using [Observable Plot](plot) if you want to create _simple_ charts from your data; but for more complex needs, including interactivity and animations, and more generally for bespoke data visualization, you will most probably want to use D3.

Check out our [extensive documentation website](https://d3js.org/) for examples.

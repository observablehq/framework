# SQL <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/framework/releases/tag/v1.2.0" class="observablehq-version-badge" data-version="^1.2.0" title="Added in v1.2.0"></a>

Observable Framework includes built-in support for client-side SQL powered by [DuckDB](./lib/duckdb). You can use SQL to query data from [CSV](./lib/csv), [TSV](./lib/csv), [JSON](./javascript/files#json), [Apache Arrow](./lib/arrow), [Apache Parquet](./lib/arrow#apache-parquet), and DuckDB database files, which can either be static or generated by [data loaders](./loaders).

To use SQL, first register the desired tables in the page’s [front matter](./markdown#front-matter) using the **sql** option. Each key is a table name, and each value is the path to the corresponding data file. For example, to register a table named `gaia` from a Parquet file:

```yaml
---
sql:
  gaia: ./lib/gaia-sample.parquet
---
```

To load externally-hosted data, use a full URL: <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/framework/releases/tag/v1.4.0" class="observablehq-version-badge" data-version="^1.4.0" title="Added in 1.4.0"></a>

```yaml
---
sql:
  quakes: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.csv
---
```

<div class="tip">For performance and reliability, we recommend using local files rather than loading data from external servers at runtime. You can use a <a href="./loaders">data loader</a> to take a snapshot of a remote data during build if needed.</div>

You can also register tables via code (say to have sources that are defined dynamically via user input) by defining the `sql` symbol with [DuckDBClient.sql](./lib/duckdb).

## SQL code blocks

To run SQL queries, create a SQL fenced code block (<code>```sql</code>). For example, to query the first 10 rows from the `gaia` table:

````md
```sql
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 10
```
````

This produces a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 10
```

To refer to the results of a query in JavaScript, use the `id` directive. For example, to refer to the results of the previous query as `top10`:

````md
```sql id=top10
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 10
```
````

```sql id=top10
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 10
```

This returns an array of 10 rows as an [Apache Arrow](./lib/arrow) table, inspected here:

```js echo
top10
```

When a SQL code block uses the `id` directive, the results are not displayed by default. You can display them by adding the `display` directive, which produces the table shown above.

````md
```sql id=top10 display
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 10
```
````

The `id` directive is often a simple identifier such as `top10` above, but it supports [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), so you can refer to individual rows and columns using array and object patterns. For example, to pull out the top row:

````md
```sql id=[top]
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 1
```
````

```sql id=[top]
SELECT * FROM gaia ORDER BY phot_g_mean_mag LIMIT 1
```

```js echo
top
```

Or to pull out the minimum value of the `phot_g_mean_mag` column:

````md
```sql id=[{min}]
SELECT MIN(phot_g_mean_mag) AS min FROM gaia
```
````

```sql id=[{min}]
SELECT MIN(phot_g_mean_mag) AS min FROM gaia
```

```js echo
min
```

<div class="tip">

For complex destructuring patterns, you may need to quote the `id` directive. For example, to pull out the column named `min(phot_g_mean_mag)` to the variable named `min`, say <code style="white-space: nowrap;">id="[{'min(phot_g_mean_mag)': min}]"</code>. Or to pull out the `min` and `max` columns, say <code style="white-space: nowrap;">id="[{min, max}]"</code>.

</div>

For dynamic or interactive queries that respond to user input, you can interpolate values into SQL queries using inline expressions `${…}`. For example, to show the stars around a given brightness:

```js echo
const mag = view(Inputs.range([6, 22], {label: "Magnitude"}));
```

```sql echo
SELECT * FROM gaia WHERE phot_g_mean_mag BETWEEN ${mag - 0.1} AND ${mag + 0.1};
```

The value of a SQL code block is an [Apache Arrow](./lib/arrow) table. This format is supported by [Observable Plot](./lib/plot), so you can use SQL and Plot together to visualize data. For example, below we count the number of stars in each 2°×2° bin of the sky (where `ra` is [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension) and `dec` is [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination), representing a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system), and then visualize the resulting heatmap using a [raster mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/raster).

```sql id=bins echo
SELECT
  floor(ra / 2) * 2 + 1 AS ra,
  floor(dec / 2) * 2 + 1 AS dec,
  count() AS count
FROM
  gaia
GROUP BY
  1,
  2
```

```js echo
Plot.plot({
  aspectRatio: 1,
  x: {domain: [0, 360]},
  y: {domain: [-90, 90]},
  marks: [
    Plot.frame({fill: 0}),
    Plot.raster(bins, {
      x: "ra",
      y: "dec",
      fill: "count",
      width: 360 / 2,
      height: 180 / 2,
      imageRendering: "pixelated"
    })
  ]
})
```

## SQL literals

SQL fenced code blocks are shorthand for the `sql` tagged template literal. You can invoke the `sql` tagged template literal directly like so:

```js echo
const [row] = await sql`SELECT random() AS random`;
```

```js echo
row.random
```

The `sql` tag is useful for querying data within JavaScript, such as to query data for visualization without needing to create a separate SQL code block and giving the data a name. For example, below we use DuckDB to bin stars by brightness, and then visualize the bins as a histogram using a [rect mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/rect).

```js echo
Plot.plot({
  x: {round: true, label: "phot_g_mean_mag"},
  marks: [
    Plot.axisY({tickFormat: (d) => d / 1000, label: "count (thousands)"}),
    Plot.rectY(await sql`
      SELECT
        FLOOR(phot_g_mean_mag / 0.2) * 0.2 AS mag1
      , mag1 + 0.2 AS mag2
      , COUNT() AS count
      FROM gaia GROUP BY 1
    `, {x1: "mag1", x2: "mag2", y: "count", tip: true})
  ]
})
```

The `sql` tag is available by default in Markdown. You can also import it explicitly as:

```js run=false
import {sql} from "npm:@observablehq/duckdb";
```

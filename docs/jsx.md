# JSX

Below we import a JSX component and render it.

```jsx echo
import {Counter} from "./components/Counter.js";

display(<Counter title="Hello, JSX" />);
```

Should this page be called React? Probably, since Framework only supports JSX for React. And also React isnâ€™t really usable without JSX.

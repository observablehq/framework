# Deploying

You can host your built Framework project on any static site hosting service, or self-host it with any static site server. This guide covers deploying to [Observable](https://observablehq.com), which is the easiest way to host your Framework project as support is built-in. We’ll also cover setting up automated deploys with GitHub Actions.

<div class="tip">

If you don’t already have a project ready to deploy, create one by following our [Getting started guide](./getting-started).

</div>

## Manual deploys

First, make sure that your project builds without error:

```sh
npm run build
```

Once that is done you can deploy to Observable:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

The first time you deploy a project, you will be prompted to configure the project’s _slug_ (which determines its URL), access level, and other details. If you don’t yet have an Observable account or aren’t signed-in, you will also be prompted to sign-up or sign-in.

When the deploy command finishes, it prints a link to observablehq.cloud where you can view your deployed project. If you choose *private* as the access level, that link will only be accessible to members of your Observable workspace. (You can invite people to your workspace by going to observablehq.com.) If you chose *public*, you can share your project link with anyone. You can change the access level of a project later [from your workspace projects page](https://observablehq.com/select-workspace?next=projects).

<div class="note">The deploy command creates a file at <code>.observablehq/deploy.json</code> under the source root (typically <code>src</code>) with information on where to deploy the project. This file is required for automated deploys. You will need to commit this file to git to deploy via GitHub Actions.</div>

## Automated deploys

To set up automatic deploys (also known as *continuous deployment* or *CD*), we recommend [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). In your git repository, create and commit a file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Here is a starting example:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  # Run this workflow whenever a new commit is pushed to main.
  push: {branches: [main]}
  # Run this workflow once per day, at 10:15 UTC
  schedule: [{cron: "15 10 * * *"}]
  # Run this workflow when triggered manually in GitHub’s UI.
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Observable Cloud
        # This parameter to `--message` will use the latest commit message
        run: npm run deploy -- --message "$(git log -1 --pretty=%s)"
        env:
          # Authentication information. See below for how to set this up.
          OBSERVABLE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OBSERVABLE_TOKEN }}
```

<div class="tip">As shown above, deploy messages can be set using <code>--message</code>. This is especially useful for continuous deployment from a git repository: the message can include the SHA, author, and message of the latest commit.</div>

When deploying automatically, you can’t sign-in in your browser the way you did for manual deploys; instead, your GitHub action will authenticate using an Observable API key (also known as a *token* and referred to as `OBSERVABLE_TOKEN` above).

To create an API key:

1. Open the [API Key settings](https://observablehq.com/select-workspace?next=api-keys-settings) for your Observable workspace.
2. Click **New API Key**.
3. Check the **Deploy new versions of projects** checkbox.
4. Give your key a description, such as “Deploy via GitHub Actions”.
5. Click **Create API Key**.

<div class="caution">

The token you create is the equivalent of a password giving write access to your hosted project. **Do not commit it to git** or share it with anyone you don’t trust. If you accidentally expose your key, you can go back to your settings to immediately revoke it (and create a new key).

</div>

In a moment, you’ll copy-paste your new Observable API key, so leave this window open for now. (If you accidentally close the window, you can delete the old key and create a new one. For security, API keys are only shown once upon creation.)

To authenticate with Observable and to access the Observable API key securely from our Github action, we’ll use a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

To create a GitHub secret, in a new window:

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. In the top navigation, click **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables**, then **Actions**.
4. Click **New repository secret**.
5. In the **Name** field, enter `OBSERVABLE_TOKEN`.
6. In the **Secret** field, paste the API key you created on Observable.
7. Click **Add secret**.

After you’ve performed these steps, the `deploy.yml` above will automatically build and deploy your project once per day (to keep your data up-to-date), as well as whenever you push a new version of the code to your repository (so you can make changes at any time).

### Caching

If some of your data loaders take a long time to run, or simply don’t need to be updated every time you modify the code, you can set up caching to automatically re-use existing data from previous builds. To do that, add the following steps to your `deploy.yml` before you run `build`:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      # ...
      - id: date
        run: echo "date=$(TZ=America/Los_Angeles date +'%Y-%m-%d')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      - id: cache-data
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: src/.observablehq/cache
          key: data-${{ hashFiles('src/data/*') }}-${{ steps.date.outputs.date }}
      # ...
```

This uses one cache per calendar day (in the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone). If you deploy multiple times in a day, the results of your data loaders will be reused on the second and subsequent runs. You can customize the `date` and `cache-data` steps to change the cadence of the caching. For example you could use `date +'%Y-%U'` to cache data for a week or `date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H` to cache it for only an hour.

<div class="note">You’ll need to edit the paths above if you’ve configured a source root other than <code>src</code>.</div>

## Other hosting services

Observable Framework builds a set of static files that can be hosted by any static site hosting services. To build your project, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then upload the contents of your `dist` directory to your static service of choice.

<div class="tip">By default, Framework generates “clean” URLs by dropping the `.html` extension from page links. Not all webhosts support this; some need the <a href="./config#cleanUrls"><b>cleanUrls</b> config option</a> set to false.</div>

<div class="tip">When deploying to GitHub Pages without using GitHub’s related actions (<a href="https://github.com/actions/configure-pages">configure-pages</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages">deploy-pages</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact">upload-pages-artifact</a>), you may need to create a <code>.nojekyll</code> file in your <code>dist</code> folder after building. See GitHub’s documentation on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#static-site-generators">static site generators</a> for more.</div>

# Observable Framework

[**Observable Framework**](https://observablehq.com/framework/) is a free, [open-source](./LICENSE), static site generator for data apps, dashboards, reports, and more. Framework combines JavaScript on the front-end for interactive graphics with any language on the back-end for data analysis. Framework features [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders) that precompute static snapshots of data at build time for dashboards that load instantly.
